<p>The purpose of this script is to output tables and figures that can be pasted into the Word Doc of the manuscript.
I’m separating this from the supplement because I will render the supplement to html until Word or PDF is needed.</p>
<p>Divide the paper into those used for the main text and those used for the supplement.</p>
