Filename: 4_main_text_tables_figs.Rmd

The purpose of this script is to output tables and figures that can be pasted into the Word Doc of the manuscript. I'm separating this from a similar script for the supplement because I will render the supplement to html until Word or PDF is needed. 

For the supplement version, see green-space-denver/docs/4_appendix_tables_figs.Rmd
